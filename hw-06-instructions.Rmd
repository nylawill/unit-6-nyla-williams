# Learning goals

-   Write a function in an R script and load it using `source()`
-   Iterate a function over multiple data structures

## Data

```{r photo, fig.margin = TRUE, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 3, fig.cap = "Chicago temperatures - February 2021", eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/feb-2021-cold.jpeg")
```

We will be working with data downloaded from [Weather Underground](https://www.wunderground.com/) for three stations:  

- The Loop - `chicago-loop.csv`
- Southloop - `chicago-south-loop.csv`
- Oak Park - `chicago-oak-park.csv`

Each dataset has daily min, average, and max temperatures for each day in February 2021.  

This was one of the coldest and snowiest Februarys in recent Chicago history!

## Packages

We will need `{dplyr}` and `{purrr}` package functions from the tidyverse, and date functions from `lubridate`.

```{r message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
```

## Warm up

Before we introduce the data, let's warm up with some simple exercises:  

- Update the YAML, changing the author name to your name, and **knit** the document.
- Commit your changes with a meaningful commit message.
- Push your changes to GitHub.

## Importing the function

Below is code that creates a `convert_temperature()` function.  

Do **not** copy it into the homework 6 starter file.  

Instead, we are going to save our function code in an R script.

1.  Open a new `R Script` (under File \> New File \> R Script) and copy and paste in the code to create the function into scripting window.  

* Exclude the top and bottom lines of the chunk (i.e. the lines that start with three back-ticks). 
* Save the R script file as "convert_temperature.R" in the same directory as your starter file .Rmd. 
* Finally, copy the code chunk below titled `import-convert-temperature` into Exercise 1 in your starter file. You will need to change `eval = T`.

```{r write-convert-temperature}
convert_temperature <- function(temperature_vector){
  
  celcius <- (temperature_vector - 32) * (5/9) 
  kelvin <- celcius + 273.15 
    
  tibble("fahrenheit" = temperature_vector,
         "celcius" = celcius,
         "kelvin" = kelvin) 
  
}
```

```{r import-convert-temperature, eval = F}
source("convert_temperature.R")
```

üß∂ ‚úÖ ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Knit, *commit, and push your changes to GitHub with an appropriate commit message.*

### End of Exercise 1

It is standard practice in R to keep the underlying code for your functions separate from the main RMarkdown file you work within for a project.  

We just created an R script containing the code for `convert_temperature()` and saved it with the name `convert_temperature.R`.  

When we run the function `source("convert_temperature.R")`, R executes the code in that R script in our RMarkdown environment and, as a result, creates the function object `convert_temperature()`.

2.  Let's test out the function we just imported.  

* Insert a new labeled code chunk below Exercise 2 in your starter file. 
* Write a single line of code that will test your function with the single Fahrenheit value = `32`.

### End of Exercise 2

## Importing and recoding the data

3.  Look at the 3 `.csv` files in your starter directory `/data` folder:  

* Insert a labeled code chunk under Exercise 3 in your starter file that imports each of the three datasets.
* Assign each of them to object names of your choice.
  + Remember, you cannot use hyphens (`-`) in object names, but you can use underscores (`_`)!
* Add a second labeled chunk below the first, that gives you a glimpse of each dataset.
    
### End of Exercise 3

4.  Notice that the `date` column is still as data type `character string`. We need to fix that!  

* Copy the first code chunk from Exercise 3, that you used to **import** the data, into Exercise 4 in your starter file.
* Import the data again, and over-write the same objects, but this time, pass the `col_types` argument within `read_csv()` a vector of `col_type()` functions to correctly read the first column as dates.
* Remember you will need to change your chunk label.
* Finally, add a second labeled chunk below the first, that gives you a glimpse of each dataset.
* Confirm that they now have the correct `date` column data type.
  + Hint: If you are struggling with the col_type argument, you can check the syntax in Week 9 slides on Blackboard `importing and recoding data`.
  
### End of Exercise 4

## Wrangling and merging the data

5.  Copy the code chunk below into Exercise 5 in your starter file. Complete it so that each data set is changed in the following ways:  

* `mutate()` is used to create a new column called `neighborhood`
* `relocate()` is used to move the new column to the first column position
* In the last pipeline, join each dataset using `bind_rows()`
* Call the new data object `chicago_temperatures`. 
  + Remember to change `eval = T`.

```{r wrangle-and-merge-data, eval = F}
loop <- loop %>% 
  mutate(neighborhood = "loop") %>% 
  relocate(___)

south_loop <- south_loop %>% 
  mutate(neighborhood = "___") %>% 
  ___(neighborhood)

oak_park <- oak_park %>% 
  mutate(___ = "___") %>% 
  ___(___)

___ <- loop %>% 
  bind_rows(south_loop) %>% 
  bind_rows(oak_park)
```

### End of Exercise 5

## Visualize the data

6.  Let's make a plot to visualize the data and determine which neighborhood was typically the coldest in February 2021:  

* Insert and label a code chunk below Exercise 6 in your starter file that takes `chicago_temperatures` as the input dataset.
* Map `date` on the x-axis, `temperature_high` on the y-axis, and `neighborhood` to the `color` aesthetic.
* Pick a geometry that you think allows clear distinction of each neighborhood.

### End of Exercise 6

7.  We might hypothesize that proximity to lake water keeps downtown Chicago neighborhoods like the Loop and South Loop a little warmer than inland neighborhoods like Oak Park.  

* Does our average temperature data support this hypothesis?
* Answer with text narrative under Exercise 7 in your starter file.

### End of Exercise 7

## Iterate the conversion function

`map()` iterates functions over elements in a list, however, our data is currently in a data frame, rather than a standard list.

8.  Copy and complete the code chunk below into Exercise 8 in your starter file. Complete it to:  

* Create a list of length 3 from the 3 temperature columns in the `chicago_temperatures` data frame object.
* Remember to change `eval = T`.

```{r create-list, eval = F}
chicago_temperatures_list <- ___(chicago_temperatures$temperature_high,
                                  ___$temperature_avg,
                                  ___$temperature_low)
```

### End of Exercise 8

9.  Now we are ready to apply our function `convert_temperature()` to the list object.  

* Write and label a code chunk under Exercise 9 in your starter file.
* It apply the `convert_temperature()` function to each vector element in your new list object;
* Then it will combine output together **by row** into a dataframe.
  + Hint: check the slide or help page on `map()` functions if you're not sure.
  + Assign your output to `chicago_temperatures_converted`.
  
### End of Exercise 9  

10. Copy and complete the code below into Exercise 10 of your starter file.  

* Once completed, the code should rejoin the converted temperature data frame to the first two columns of the original `chicago_temperatures` data frame (i.e. `neighborhood` and `date`).
* Remember to change `eval = T`.

```{r rejoin-data, eval = F}
___ %>% 
    pivot_longer(
    names_to = "measurement",
    values_to = "fahrenheit",
    cols = 3:5
  ) %>% 
  select(___, ___) %>% 
  bind_cols(chicago_temperatures_converted)
```

### End of Exercise 10

Great work!  

We just worked through applying our own custom function to a list object.  

This was an improvement over copying and pasting the function multiple times.  

Moreover, knowing how to write your own functions is a valuable R programming skill!  

However, remember that we could have completed this temperature conversion more quickly using tidy data and tidyverse functions.  

Below is an example of a tidyverse pipeline we could have used.

```{r tidyverse-version, eval = F}
chicago_temperatures %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    names_to = "measurement",
    values_to = "fahrenheit",
    cols = 3:5
  ) %>% 
  mutate(celcius = (fahrenheit - 32) * (5/9),
         kelvin  = celcius + 273.15)
```
